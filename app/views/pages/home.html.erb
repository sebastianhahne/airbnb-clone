      <p>There's a lady who's sure <br>
        All that glitters is gold <br>
        And she's buying a stairway to Heaven <br>
        When she gets there she knows <br>
        If the stores are all closed <br>
        With a word she can get what she came for <br>
        Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven <br>
        There's a sign on the wall <br>
        But she wants to be sure <br>
        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings <br>
        In a tree by the brook <br>
        There's a songbird who sings <br>
        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving <br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder <br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder <br>
        There's a feeling I get <br>
        When I look to the west <br>
        And my spirit is crying for leaving <br>
        In my thoughts I have seen <br>
        Rings of smoke through the trees <br>
        And the voices of those who standing looking <br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder <br>
        Ooh, it really makes me wonder <br>
        And it's whispered that soon, If we allâ€¦ <br>
        If there's a bustle in your hedgerow <br>
        Don't be alarmed now <br>
        It's just a spring clean for the May queen <br>
        Yes, there are two paths you can go by <br>
        But in the long run <br>
        There's still time to change the road you're on <br>
        And it makes me wonder <br>
        Your head is humming and it won't go <br>
        In case you don't know <br>
        The piper's calling you to join him <br>
        Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? <br>
        And did you know <br>
        Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? <br>
        And as we wind on down the road <br>
        Our shadows taller than our soul <br>
        There walks a lady we all know <br>
        Who shines white light and wants to show <br>
        How everything still turns to gold <br>
        And if you listen very hard <br>
        The tune will come to you at last <br>
        When all are one and one is all <br>
        To be a rock and not to roll <br>
      And she's buying a stairway to Heaven</p>
